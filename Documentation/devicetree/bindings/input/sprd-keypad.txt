* sprd's Keypad Controller device tree bindings

sprd's Keypad controller is used to interface a SoC with a matrix-type
keypad device. The keypad controller supports multiple row and column lines.
A key can be placed at each intersection of a unique row and a unique column.
The keypad controller can sense a key-press and key-release and report the
event using a interrupt to the cpu.

Required SoC Specific Properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following
  - "sprd,v0-keypad": For controllers compatible with keypad version 0
    controller.
  - "sprd,v1-keypad": For controllers compatible with keypad version 1
    controller.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu.

- sprd,glb-rst-off: Offset of AON APB RESET register which contains
  keypad soft reset bit

- sprd,glb-eb-off: Offset of AON APB EB register which contains keypad
  enable bit

- sprd,glb-rtc-eb-off: Offset of AON APB EB register which contains
  keypad rtc enable bit

- sprd,bit-kpd-soft-rst: Bit of keypad soft reset

- sprd,bit-kpd-eb: Bit of keypad enable

- sprd,bit-kpd-rtc-eb: Bit of keypad rtc enable


Required Board Specific Properties:
- sprd,num-rows: Number of row lines connected to the keypad
  controller.

- sprd,num-columns: Number of column lines connected to the
  keypad controller.

- Keys represented as child nodes: Each key connected to the keypad
  controller is represented as a child node to the keypad controller
  device node and should include the following properties.
  - keypad,row: the row number to which the key is connected.
  - keypad,column: the column number to which the key is connected.
  - linux,code: the key-code to be reported when the key is pressed
    and released.

- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".

Optional Properties:
- wakeup-source: use any event on keypad as wakeup event.
(Legacy property supported: "linux,input-wakeup")

Optional Properties specific to linux:
- linux,repeat: enable autorepeat feature.
